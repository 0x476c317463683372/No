# No

Linux has a built in 'yes' command utility. But it doesn't include a 'no' command utility.<br/>
The 'yes' command utility it takes <b>zero or more</b> strings as arguments and prints them infinitely to the screen. It's useful in some cases.<br/><br/>
The 'no' command utility does exactly the opposite thing. It's like yes, but actually no. Like 'yes', 'no' takes <b>zero or more</b> strings as arguments. But instead of printing them infinitely to the screen the 'no' command utility prints them one and only one time into the screen, just like echo. It's not useful at all.
